                    brutal conquest of Ionia. After being betrayed by her own command and witnessing the horror of Zaunite 
                    chemicals used on soldiers, she shattered her runic blade, severed ties with Noxus, 
                    and entered self-imposed exile to seek atonement, eventually facing judgment for her past.</p>
